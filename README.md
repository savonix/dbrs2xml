dbrs2xml
========

Summary
-------
A FastCGI application to process SQL and return XML data sets.


Requirements
------------

* FastCGI
* MySQL Client Library
* qDecoder with slight modifications
* libxml2
* libxslt

Recommended
-----------

* Nginx
* Spawn-FCGI
* tinycdb
* libmemcached

Usage
-----
Not done yet. The basic idea is that the url will point to a resource which
represents a query. It could point to an actual query file, but it doesn't have
to. Query parameters would be passed in the query string or as POST data.

More sophisticated plans are in the works to provide multiple queries within one
resource, as well as the processing of data between queries.

TODO
----

* SQL query format: request is for a SQL query file
* URL routing to query methodology
* Security

Ideas
-----

* use libtidy to clean out the contents of pre tags
* http://tidy.sourceforge.net/libintro.html
* use pcre to...
* Memcached support?
* hook to source-highlight?
* use qDecoder database interface?
* Evaluate tie-ins with NEotoyz.com
* Shared memory?
